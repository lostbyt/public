Some python programs developped for post production:

-Auto beauty: This tool for Nuke software, will allow the user to import a multi render pass from Cycle(Blender) or Redshift and reconstruct to match the beauty. Some options like denoise, sharpen, and grade are directly implemented in the menu.

-Fake parallax: This tool for Nuke software is based on a Alexander Hanneman tutorial (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avtDQcZNThI), it allows to quickly create a "push in zoom" with parallax even with 2D elements. It uses a uv distortion map.
The tool automates all the process, the user has just to plug his rotos and setup the movment he wants.

-Reads cleaner: This is a tool I wrote to help organize the reads node in a nuke script. You can order them by ascending/ descending frame range lenght or by name.
